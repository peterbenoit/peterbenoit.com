    <h1>A Story</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a boy and a girl who were friends. They met playing online video games, and instantly hit it off. As time went on, they grew closer, sharing more than just the game itself.</p>

    <p>One day, he noticed her drifting away. The activities they once enjoyed together were replaced with something—or perhaps someone—new. His feelings for her, feelings he hadn't even admitted to himself, started to tangle him up inside. So, he retreated, stopped playing the game.</p>

    <p>For a year, she flickered through his thoughts daily. Then, a Christmas card – a relic of the past – brought her back to the forefront. He missed her desperately and reached out.</p>

    <p>She replied, and it seemed like old times for a while. But there were hints of change. She mentioned a new boy, and the boy's heart sank. Still, her friendship was a treasure he didn't want to lose.</p>

    <p>He confessed his feelings, and her reply was a gentle blow. She loved this other boy. It hurt, but their connection, the fragments that remained, were too precious to discard. He retreated again, but less completely this time.</p>

    <p>Opportunity knocked: why not visit her, rekindle some of the fun they used to have? The trip was a whirlwind—laughter, shared memories. It felt so good. Until it didn't. Her feelings for the new boy, she confessed, had only intensified.</p>

    <p>His heart ached. How to hold onto her without the hope of something more? "Let's just be friends," he heard himself say, and meant it... mostly.</p>

    <p>The end (for now).</p>
