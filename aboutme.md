My name is Peter Benoit, but I go by Pete. That's much better. All the best Peters are Petes.

I used to live in Atlanta, but I'm not from there. Now I'm somewhere else.

I have the following qualities:

- I rock an awesome beard
- I love my dog

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, there's so much history to be had, I'm not sure where to begin. I've worked at a few places, made a few friends, and learned a thing or two along the way.

If you really want to know more about me, why not ask?  <i class="fa fa-arrow-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
