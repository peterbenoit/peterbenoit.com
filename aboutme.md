My name is Peter Benoit, but I go by Pete. That's much better. All the best Peter's are Pete's.

I have the following qualities:

- I rock an awesome beard
- I love my dogs

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now. There's so much history to be had. I've worked at a few places, made a few friends, and learned a thing or two along the way. I can't say I'm the greatest developer you'll ever meet, I'll leave that to every other developer with an inferiority complex to try to convince you of.
